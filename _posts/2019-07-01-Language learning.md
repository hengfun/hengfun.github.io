At Chat2Learn we believe the best way to learn language is through immersion. The act of trying to communicate an idea,
 express an emotion or a feeling to another individual transcends the spoken language. Expression is a muscle that is 
 best trained through interaction, and not rote memorization or book reading. That is why we are building a conversational
  AI agent that let's the user practice language.
